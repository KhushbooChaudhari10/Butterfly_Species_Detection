Problem Statement: Butterfly Image Classification

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify different species of butterflies based on images. The model should be able to take an input image of a butterfly and predict its species with a high degree of accuracy.

Dataset:
You are provided with a labeled dataset containing images of various butterfly species. Each image is labeled with the corresponding butterfly species. The dataset consists of a diverse set of butterfly images captured under different lighting conditions, angles, and backgrounds. The dataset is split into a training set and a validation set.

Key Tasks:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset. This may include resizing images to a consistent size, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the data into training and validation sets.

Model Selection: Choose an appropriate deep learning architecture for image classification. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image classification tasks due to their ability to learn hierarchical features from images.

Model Development: Develop and train the selected model using the training dataset. Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and regularization techniques to achieve the best performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using the validation dataset. Use appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance. This might involve adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, and regularization parameters.

Data Augmentation: Implement data augmentation techniques to increase the model's robustness and generalization ability. Techniques like rotation, flipping, and cropping can help expose the model to variations in the data.

Model Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is achieved, deploy it for inference. Users should be able to input images, and the model should provide predictions about the butterfly species.

Deliverables:

Preprocessed and split dataset.
Trained model's code and weights.
Evaluation metrics and model performance analysis.
Model deployment code (optional).
Documentation outlining the data preprocessing steps, model architecture, training process, and evaluation results.
Success Criteria:
The project will be considered successful if the developed model achieves a classification accuracy of at least 90% on the validation dataset. Additionally, the model's performance should be consistent across different lighting conditions and background variations.
